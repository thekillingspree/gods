Data Structures implemented in Go. 

I created this project to improve my understanding of Data Structures and the Go language. 

Note: This is just a learning experiment. There are better implementations of data structures in Go, the best one as far as I know is available [here](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods)

## Contributing

If you want to add a new data structure, you can do so by creating a new package in the root directory. Please include tests as well.
